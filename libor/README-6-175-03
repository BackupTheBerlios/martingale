LMMs working on swaptions and caplets,
Book swaption formula verified.

5-30-03:

Most files split into .cc and .h files.
templatization of boost::random random number generators
causes problems, reverted to Random::U01 in all nonessentail applications.
Standard normal deviates are still Mersenne twister mt19937 based.

LiborProcess, LognormalLiborVector, EmpiricalRandomVariable (is part of
RandomVariables) deleted.


6-2-03:

Massive linking problems when splitting StochasticProcesses, TestLMM, 
TestProbabiliy, TestMatrix into .h and .cc files.
"Undefined reference foo" although foo is defined in the .cc file
and no templates are involved. Cannot understand what's going on.

Matrix class expanded to encompass non square matrices.
Matrix multiply and exponential tests still pass.


6-15-03:

Working on LiborTree2F.h
TnT.h can be eliminated. Integrated into Matrices.h as global functions.
