<h1>Major Unresolved Issues</h1>

The following need ultimately to be resolved:

<H3>Predictor corrector blowup</H3>

Why do caplet prices blow up in dimension n&gt;=70 when predictor-corrector
simulation is used. Is this a bug or a weakness in the predictor-corrector approximation?
<p>
Resolved. Phenomenon disappeared after code rewrite. 


<H3>Memory Leak</H3>

Check the matrix, vector and array classes for proper deallocation of resources.
The old calibration code (7-17-03) exhibits a catastrophic memory leak.
<p>
Resolved.
