LiborMarketModel and drived classes:

the use of the cache XLvec is the only reason that the member function
XLvec(t,p) is not constant and that propagates through basically all the
Libor quantity member functions.

Reflect upon wether it's worth it or wether we should return from the stack.


INCLUDE ANALYIS

Get all definitions that need an include out of header files.
Use forward declarations instead of includes in header files.
Headers include much less and the forward declarations give us a much better 
picture of the dependencies.

All files have been rewritten in this way and there is only one problem left before
linkage:
No method Random::sTN()...

Check if unwanted ifndef in source files.


State 7-17-03:

Include structure is still sloppy.
Why don't we have to qualify "cout" as "std::cout"??
Should we simply include <string> and <iostream> in TypedefsMacros.h (and hence everywhere)?
Explore the difference between <math.h> and <cmath>.

LmmLattice2F,3F: implement a choice of wether we rescale the covariation matrix root to preserve
volatilities or not so we can test what works better.

Known problems:

a) std::ostream operator << (std::ostream& os, const SomeType& x)
doesn't link but x->printSelf(os) works. Why is that?

b) Examples::brownianMotionInBall(dim,T,dt,nPath) dies on array index out of bounds error.
