<h1>TO DO - 9-22-03</h1>

<b>Copy constructors, operator =, destructors</b> are not defined for all classes even if the
the compiler supplied versions (shallow copy) won't do. A case in point is the class
LiborMarketModel (LMM). I don't envision a use of this class where these are needed.
However I cannot know what you want to do. Will be fixed in the future.

<p>

<b>Resource ownership:</b> for each matrix function returning a reference document if the user 
has to deallocate the resource. 

<p>

<b>LmmLattice</b>
<ul>
<li><i>Volatility rescaling</i> introduce a parameter which allows us to 
control to which percent the volatility is rescaled. Swaption price experiments
indicate that full rescale overshoots the target.</li>

<li><i>Exercise times:</i> Since the method <code>Option::isExercisable(Real t)</code>
uses continuous time t, the lattice pricing code in Pricing.h relies
on the comparison of floats when instantiated for Bermudan swaptions. 
This is fragile and works only if the exercise times are exact integral multiples of the
lattice time step. Reflect upon alternatives.</li>
</ul>

<p>

<b>Control variates:</b> seem to have an adverse effect despite extremely high 
correlation.  Investigate this by computing the mean and variance of the caplet price over say 20
runs for caplets in a PC LMM (where we have exact analytics) with and without
control variates.

<p>

<b>LiborMarketModel and drived classes:</b>
the use of the cache XLvec is the only reason that the member function
XLvec(t,p) is not constant and that propagates through basically all the
Libor quantity member functions.
Reflect upon wether it's worth it or wether we should return from the stack.

<p>

<b>Doxygen-docs</b>
<ul>
<li>Write extensive doxygen-docs for LiborCalibrator.h.</li>
<li>Link all file descriptions to the classes defined in the files.</li>
</ul>

<p>

<b>Matrix:</b> <code>UTRMatrix&lt;Real&gt;</code> is not the same as 
<code>UTRRealMatrix</code>. 
This is due to the fact that there are no templated typdefs. 
Affects: RandomObject. The covariation matrix has type <code>UTRMatrix&lt;S&gt;</code>.
Thus the functionality of <code>UTRRealMatrix</code> is not available for RandomObjects 
with Real scalars (factor analysis, matrix functions). Possible solutions:
Move the functionality of <code> UTRRealMatrix</code> to the more general type  
<code>UTRMatrix&lt;S&gt;</code> or limit RandomObjects to Real scalars.

<p>

<b>Headers:</b> clear up the problem with the typedef in forward declarations and remove 
"#include Matrix.h" from headers if it is not really needed.

<h2>Last: 9-21-03</h2>

Bug in <code>Random::MersenneTwister::u01()</code><br>
<code>kk+MT_D</code> should be
<code>kk-MT_D</code>. This writes off the end of the array <code>mt</code>.
Fixed: 9-22-03.
